# ganache
A simple GUI library for Rust

### Features
* Rendering backend agnostic; returns a list of draw commands
* Widget styling support
* Generic over lots of things (draw commands, theme resources, input events, etc.)

### Known issues
* Not optimized and probably not very fast yet
* Widget styles would be more ergonomic as structs
